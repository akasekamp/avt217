    <h1>Draw With Me! &#9786;</h1>
    <p>First, open up Adobe XD. </p>
    <p>The canvas size will be 1000 by 1000px. </p>
    <p>We are going to make a triforce emblem from The Legend of Zelda (if you know what that is).<p>
    <p>Make a 700 by 700px triangle, no fill, you can leave the outline. </p>
    <p>Just go ahead and center that on the canvas. </p>
    <p>This will be our outline to understand the layout.</p>
    <p>Then make three 352 by 250 pixel triangles.</p>
    <p>Make each smaller triangle a bright yellow color, you can leave the grey outline.</p>
    <p>Then at the base of our big triangle, inside put two of the smaller triangle directly next to each other.</p>
    <p>Then take your third smaller triangle and essentially stack it on top your two other small ones.</p>
    <p>It should look like a big triangle, two on the bottom, one on top, and one upside white triangle in the middle.</p>
    <p>You are done with the drawing so export it now as a PNG. Name it drawing.png so I can find it easily!</p>
    <p>After you have exported the file into a PNG go ahead and email it to akasekam@masonlive.gmu.edu or you can find me on slack and DM me @ Allison Kasekamp and send it on there.</p>
    <p>Good Luck! </p>
