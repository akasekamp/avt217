        <h2>Randyland</h2>
        <p>Randy sees things before they are there. Where most saw a dilapidated building surrounded by crime, Randy saw an opportunity to create a place of cheerfulness for generations of people to enjoy. He knew that love would fill the cracks. He became an artist by picking up a brush and paint, and creating patterns on things he would find in the garbage. This idea has been expanding for the past 25 years, and his museum of happiness is the amazing result. Randy’s vision continues to inspire all who visit him, in person and virtually. His message of love and happiness is most needed in the world today!</p>
